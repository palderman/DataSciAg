2. The project uses skills/practices from at least three of the five course modules
3. The project implements some new analysis and generates novel results of some kind (i.e. it should do more than generate and discuss summary graphs/statistics)

## Project Report - 42 points

### Evaluation Criteria

1. The report includes an abstract (<200 words) that summarizes the report including key findings and conclusions.

2. The report thoroughly introduces the topic/research question, explains their relevance and importance, and summarizes current knowledge on the topic.

3. The report provides a detailed description of methods used for data curation and analysis including where you obtained the data from, a summary of the original methods used to collect the data, and the procedure you used to curate, combine, and analyze them. This should be described in enough detail that a future student could exactly duplicate your analysis. Any software or hardware used in the study should be properly cited.

4. The report thoroughly describes the results of the analysis and discusses them in terms of theoretical and practical significance. All figures and tables of results included in the report should be mentioned and discussed. The discussion of results should make reference to existing knowledge including content from the course and relevant peer-reviewed sources.

5. The report contains a final section which adequately summarizes the main points of the report including:
    - Highlights from the introduction, results and discussion
    - Any conclusions that can be derived from them
    - Possible future research directions

6. The report is well-organized and free of grammatical and spelling errors. It includes:
    - A title page (with an informative title)
    - Appropriate headings (e.g. Introduction, Methods, Results, etc.)
    - A complete, consistently formatted list of references cited
